      <h2>Introduction To Python</h2>
      <p>
          Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations of
          variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and flexible,
          and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. Python tracks the types of all values
          at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.
      </p>
      <p>
          An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it.
          If you ever have a question like, "What happens if I add an int to a list?" Just typing it into the python
          interpreter is a fast and likely the best way to see what happens. (See below to see what really happens!)
      </p>
      <pre>
$ python       <span> ## Run the Python interpreter</span>
<span class="purple">Python</span> 3.7.0 (default, Aug 20 2018, 03:41:42)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux
<span class="purple">Type</span> "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = 6       <span>## set a variable in this interpreter session</span>
>>> a           <span>## entering an expression prints its value</span>
6
>>> a + 2
8
>>> a = 'hi'    <span>## 'a' can hold a string just as well</span>
>>> a
'hi'
>>> len(a)      <span>## call the len() function on a string</span>
2
>>> a + len(a)  <span>## try something that doesn't work</span>
<span class="purple">Traceback</span> (most recent call last):
  <span class="purple">File</span> "", line 1, in
<span class="purple">TypeError</span>: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
>>> a + str(len(a))  <span>## probably what you really wanted</span>
'hi2'
>>> foo         <span>## try something else that doesn't work</span>
<span class="purple">Traceback</span> (most recent call last):
  <span class="purple">File</span> "", line 1, in
<span class="purple">NameError</span>: name 'foo' is not defined
>>> ^D          <span>## type CTRL-c to exit (CTRL-z in Windows/DOS terminal)</span>
    </pre>
    <p>
      As you can see above, it's easy to experiment with variables and operators.
       Also, the interpreter throws, or "raises" in Python parlance, a runtime error
       if the code tries to read a variable that has not been assigned a value. Like C++ and Java,
       Python is case sensitive so "a" and "A" are different variables. The end of a line marks the
        end of a statement, so unlike C++ and Java, Python does not require a semicolon at the end of
         each statement. Comments begin with a '#' and extend to the end of the line.
    </p>
    <h2>Python Source code</h2>
    <p>Python source files use the ".py" extension and are called "modules." With a Python module hello.py,
      the easiest way to run it is with the shell command "python hello.py" which calls the Python interpreter
      to execute the code in hello.py. See the official docs page on all
      the different options you have when running Python from the command-line.<br><br>

     Here's a very simple hello.py program (notice that blocks of code are delimited strictly using indentation rather than
curly braces â€” more on this later!):</p>
  <pre>
<span>#!/usr/bin/env python</span>

<span># Gather our code in a main() function</span>
def main():
   print 'Hello World!'

<span># Standard boilerplate to call the main() function to begin the program.</span>
if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()

  </pre>
  <h4>Running this program from the command line looks like:</h4>
  <pre>
$ python hello.py
Hello World!
  </pre>
