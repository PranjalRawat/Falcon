  <h2>Varibles</h2>
  <p>Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need
    to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
    <br>
    This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.
  </p>
  <h3>Numbers</h3>
    <p> Python supports two types of numbers - integers and floating point numbers.
      (It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial).
      <br>
      To define an integer, use the following syntax:
      
    </p>
    <pre>
  <span># declaring integer with name var </span>
  var = 23
    </pre>


  <h3>Strings</h3>
  <p>Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.
    <br>
    The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes
    (whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes).
  </p>

     <pre>
  <span># declaring string with name str </span>
  str = 'I am a string'
     </pre>


  <h3>Variable Naming Convention</h3>
  <p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, name, cost_of_car).<br> Rules for Python variables: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
    <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
    <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
    <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
  </ul>
